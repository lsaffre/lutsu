========================
The "Lutsu club" vision
========================

Posted by Luc Saffre on Sunday, January 13, 2019.

Imagine that some countries would declare to found a "Lutsu club" and sign the :doc:`manifesto </manifesto>`.  They would
adapt their laws and state that they refuse to protect usage rights on
intellectual property.  Citizens of those countries would have the legal right
to freely copy and reuse anything that has been published anywhere in the
world, including in countries who are not member of the Lutsu club.

The Lutsu club countries would found an international NGO whose mission would
be to manage the revenues on public commons.  Every member country would
collect a "public commons" tax from its citizens. Content producers in the
Lutsu countries would receive a part of this income.

Of course the NGO would also have quite some administrative costs for
distributing the income in a transparent and democratic way.  It would probably
set up different systems for measuring the "merits" of content providers.  For
example it might ask the individual citizens to "vote" for their favourite
content providers. It might employ experts of different areas who would
evaluating content.  All these costs would probably remain below the current
costs for enforcing copyrights.

Content producers located in non-member countries might try to protect their
"property". They might try to prevent "their" content from "leaking" into the
free countries by manipulating the Internet or by other means.  They might
declare war against the Lutsu club countries. But there's an easier solution:
they just a open branch office in some member country and apply for financial
contribution.  And they will receive a transparently and democratically
allocated contribution which will be theoretically equivalent to their
production costs.

All basic activities of content providers would continue as now, but of course
would gradually adapt to the new commercial situation.

Above vision is based on the assumption that the member countries collect a
"public commons tax".  That should be the topic for our next blog post.
