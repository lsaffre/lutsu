The EU's new `copyright directive
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market>`__
is **actually a good thing for free culture**. I signed petitions against this
directive, but now I changed my mind. The EU is right, I was wrong. This
thought has been knocking at my brain for quite some time, but I realized this
only now.

Imagine a guy who would find some *legal* way to distribute guns or other
weapons to school children.  The number of accidents would increase, wouldn't
it? And who would be responsible?

When you operate a platform that gives people the possibility to upload and
share digital content, you make profit from the fact that people love sharing,
and that some of them sometimes are not aware about copyright restrictions.
Your platform increases the number of accidental damages to copyright. Until
now it was not clear that you were the responsible.  The law about upload
filters makes things clear.

Or when you pay a team of journalists for writing good news articles, and when
you earn money by letting your customers pay for the usage of your work, you
will of course not* be glad if somebody finds a legal way for sharing your work
without asking your permission. The law about link tax makes things clear.

The copyright directive is a good thing for free culture because it shows that
copyright is getting absurd.

The copyright system has become absurd in a digital civilization. It is time to
realize it.  If you agree with me, consider joining the `Lutsu project
