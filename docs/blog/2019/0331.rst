The EU's new `copyright directive
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market>`__
is actually **a good thing for free culture**. This thought has been knocking
at my brain for quite some time, but I opened the door only now.

Imagine a guy who would find some *legal* way to distribute guns or some other
kind of weapons to school children.  The number of accidents would increase.
Who would be responsible?

When you operate a platform that gives people the possibility to upload and
share digital content, you make profit from the fact that people love sharing,
and some of them sometimes are not aware about copyright restrictions. Your
platform increases the number of accidental damages to copyright. Until now it
was not clear that you were the responsible.  The law about upload filters
makes things clear.

Or, when you pay a journalist for writing good new articles, and when you earn
money by letting people pay for the usage of that work, you will of course not*
be glad if somebody finds a legal way for sharing your work without asking your
permission. The law about link tax makes things clear.

The copyright directive is a good thing for free culture because it shows that
copyright is getting absurd.

The copyright system has become absurd in a digital civilization. It is time to
realize it.  If you agree with me, consider joining the `Lutsu project
