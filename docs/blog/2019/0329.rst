"A Dark Day for the Web: EU Parliament Approves Damaging Copyright Rules"

My comment: Has somebody tried to compute how much human power and public money
has been used in the last five years for this discussion? I don't know the
number, but we probably agree that it is *huge*. What a waste of money and
energy! It is wasted because it is on a foundation that is going to vanish.

The author's right of owning a digitally published content (and deciding how it
may be used or not) is similar to that law about owning the space above and
below your land.

Until 1945, American law held that a property owner presumptively owned not
just the surface of his land, but all the land below, down to the center of the
earth, and all the space above, to “an indefinite extent, upwards.” (Lawrence
Lessig in `Free Culture <http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-2.html>`__)

It is time to realize it.  If you agree with me, consider signing the `Lutsu
manifesto <http://lutsu.saffre-rumma.net/>`__.
