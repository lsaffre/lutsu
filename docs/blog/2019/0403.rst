Public Money? Public Code!
==========================

Wednesday, April 3, 2019.

The FSFE campaign `Public Money? Public Code! <https://publiccode.eu/>`__ has
already collected more than 20K signatures. A very good thing, and well
implemented.  The video is funny and well done.  Congratulations to Max Mehl
who manages this campaign.

Maybe I should also change my "manifesto" into an "open letter"?

Anyway the Lutsu manifesto will probably remain my little private project for
some time because the idea sounds so utopic.  It is time to *start thinking*
about it, but too early to start *acting*. I am okay with this, especially as I
don't have the resources for managing a community with more than a few friends.
