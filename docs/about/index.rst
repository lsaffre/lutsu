The name is given after `Lutsu talu <http://lutsu.ee/>`__, the place where we
first talked about this topic in June 2018. The place's name comes from the
Estonian name of the Burbot (Lota lota), and the logo is taken from
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lota_lota_(Linnaeus_1758)_Fig_166_(Matschie_et_al._1909).svg
