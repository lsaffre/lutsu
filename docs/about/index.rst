About this project
==================

This project is single-person initiative designed to become a community
project. Any feedback is appreciated. Don't hesitate to contact `Luc Saffre
<http://luc.lino-framework.org/about/index.html>`__ if you want to help.

The name is given after `Lutsu talu <http://lutsu.ee/>`__, the place where we
first talked about this topic in June 2018. The place's name comes from the
Estonian name of the Burbot (Lota lota), and the logo is taken from
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lota_lota_(Linnaeus_1758)_Fig_166_(Matschie_et_al._1909).svg
