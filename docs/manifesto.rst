===================
The Lutsu manifesto
===================

We, the signers of this manifesto, declare that we want a world where published
content may be used and shared by everyone.  Published content should no longer
be considered a "private property" for which the "owner" has a "right" to
decide how it may be used or not.  This includes publications formulated as
text, picture, sound, movie or source code, and ranging from simple postings in
an Internet forum to books, songs, movies, scientific reports, patents.

We **do not want to act against any law**, we want our governments to
**fundamentally change** some of our laws currently called "copyright". These
laws are about two very different components:

- Some copyright laws give the author a **right to control** how others
  use his work.  We want our governments to abolish these.

- Some other copyright laws protect the author's **right to
  get acknowledged** (identified and honoured) as the creator of their work.  We
  want our governments to maintain and extend these.

We **want a fundamental change** in the way of how producers of digital content
are being rewarded. Publishing content should be considered an act of public
interest and rewarded as such.  The current copyright is rather a lottery than
a serious rewarding system. You *may* occasionally get famous and rich, but you
need a big portion of good luck and a good manager.

There are **several alternative ways** to reward authors and publishers. For
example they might be rewarded by a **public content tax** which should be
distributed using a transparent and democratic system under public control.

We are aware that the **transition won't be easy** because the change is
fundamental.  For example existing copyright holders must review their
established methods of generating income, governments must review their
laws,...

We believe **despite these challenges** that a transition is possible and
necessary.  We believe that this change is necessary because regulating the
use and sharing of digitally published content has become a Sisyphean task
causing absurd laws and requiring hordes of human resources in public
administrations.

**By signing this manifesto** we declare that we do our best to realize the
principal necessity of this fundamental change and to carefully develop
transition plans.  We ask the reader of this manifesto to join our movement in
order to start thinking together.
