===================
The Lutsu manifesto
===================

We, the signers of this manifesto, declare that we want a world where
**digitally published content** may be used and shared by everyone instead of
being legally considered a private property for which the "owner" decides how
it may be used or not.  This includes publications formulated as text, picture,
sound, movie or source code, and ranging from simple postings in an Internet
forum to books, songs, movies, scientific reports, patents.

We do **not want to abolish copyright** as a whole.  We want to abolish a part
of it and enforce the other part.  Laws about what is commonly called
"copyright" are about two very different components:

- Some copyright laws give the author a *right to control* how others
  use his work.  We want to abolish these.

- On the other hand there are laws that protect the author's *right to
  get acknowledged* and honoured as the creator of their work.  We
  want to maintain and extend these.

We want **a fundamental change** in the way of how producers of digital content
are being rewarding. Publishing content should be considered an act of public
interest and rewarded as such.  The current copyright is rather a lottery than
a serious rewarding system. You *may* occasionally get famous and rich, but you
need a big portion of good luck and a good manager.

There are several alternative ways to reward authors and publishers. For
example they might be rewarded by a **public content tax** which should be
distributed using a transparent and democratic system under public control.

We are aware that the **transition won't be easy** because the change is
fundamental.  For example existing copyright holders must review their
established methods of generating income, governments must review their
laws,...

But **despite these challenges** we believe that a transition is possible and
necessary.  We believe that this change is necessary because regulating the use
and sharing of digitally published content has become a Sisyphean task causing
absurd laws and requiring hordes of human resources in public administrations.

By signing this manifesto we declare that we do our best for helping others to
realize the principal necessity of this fundamental change and to carefully
develop transition plans.

We ask politicians, public deciders, experts to join our movement in order to
start thinking together.
